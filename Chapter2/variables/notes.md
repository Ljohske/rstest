# Differnces betw. var's and const's
- var in Rust:
  - Can be mutable
  - Numbers determined at runtime can be assigned to vars
    - e.g. Values returned by a function

- Const in Rust:
  - Always immutable
  - Must be set to a constant expression

## Naming convention for constants
`CAPITAL_LETTERS: type = value;`
